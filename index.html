        <h1>Why Google, Meta, and Top CEOs Will Never Notice You—Unless You Do This
        </h1>
        <p>
            Here’s the reality no one talks about: Google, Meta, and the world’s top companies only hire candidates who
            bring immediate value.
            They don’t care about your certificates, your coding bootcamp, or even your passion for programming. What
            they care about is this:</p>
        <li>Can you solve real-world problems right now?</li>
        <li> Do you understand how businesses work and what CEOs expect?</li>
        <li> Can you step into their team and deliver results from day one?</li>
        <p> If you can’t prove these things, your resume gets ignored—no matter how hard you’ve worked.</p>

        <h2>Why Top Companies Reject Most Candidates</h2>
        <P>Hiring at companies like Google and Meta isn’t just about talent. It’s about trust. CEOs and hiring managers
            don’t take risks on candidates who aren’t battle-tested. They look for:


            <li><span class="highlight">Real-world experience:</span> They don’t care how much you’ve practiced; they
                care if you’ve delivered in a
                professional environment.</li>
            <li> <span class="highlight">Corporate dynamics:</span> If you don’t understand workflows, team
                collaboration, and deadlines, you’re a
                liability, not an asset.</li>
            <li> <span class="highlight">Referrals and connections:</span> In today’s job market, who you know matters
                just as much as what you know.</li>
        <p> Here’s the hard truth: Over 80% of job openings in the tech industry are filled through referrals, not job
            boards. Google, for example, has publicly stated that 75% of their hires come from internal referrals—not
            cold applications. And Meta has admitted that most of their senior engineers are hired through employee
            recommendations.</p>
        <p>So, if you aren’t building connections with the right people— CEOs and founders—you’ll always be at a
            disadvantage.</p>
        <p>Now, how can you break through? By combining real-world skills with real-world connections.</p>

        <h3>🌟 The Shortcut to a Six-Figure Career: Internships</h3>
        <P>Internships aren’t just a stepping stone—they’re the fastest and most effective way to become the kind of
            candidate top companies fight for. Here’s why:
        </P>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Prove Your Value to CEOs:</span> When you work on real projects, you’re no
                longer a stranger on LinkedIn. You’re the person who helped them solve a real business problem. This is
                how trust is built—and trust is how jobs are offered.
            </li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Learn How Companies Like Google and Meta Actually Work:</span>Internships give
                you insider knowledge about workflows, team dynamics, and expectations in high-stakes environments. This
                is knowledge no online course can teach.
            </li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Build Relationships That Open Doors:</span> CEOs hire people they know and
                trust. Interning for a founder or executive lets you forge relationships that can fast-track your
                career.
            </li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Skip the Wait—and Get Hired Faster:</span> While others spend years trying to
                get noticed, internships let you prove your worth immediately. You’ll gain experience, connections, and
                confidence—all while building a portfolio that speaks for itself.
            </li>
